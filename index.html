                <p>In as much as their are more than 1.5 million Kenyans living with HIV&AIDS,still their are many who
                    who don't know the repuctions of the disease and they don't know what to do when they get incontact with 
                    the disease.We have seen many of them suffer in silence leading to their deaths.It is indeed a high time to 
                    raise our voices even higher and stop the tendency of loosing our beloved ones and yet they could have lived
                     for as long as they would like with the use of ARVs and even healthier lives.Lets stand with the community 
                     as a whole and make it open to everyone that getting infected with HIV&AIDS is not the end of life but instead
                     it is a beggining of a new journey.<strong>Lets stand together and revive our society.Choose to live and choose
                          to go through it.Together we can.</strong></p>
